## Structural Guidelines

### 1. Emails
**Typical Structure**  
1. **Polite Opening**: Greet briefly.  
2. **Core Message**: State your update, concern, or request succinctly.  
3. **Reflection or Next Steps**: Suggest solutions, request clarifications, or confirm future actions.  
4. **Close Naturally**: A simple line expressing thanks or good wishes, without extra formality.

**Examples**  
- **VFX Work Brief**  
  > Hello all,  
  >   
  > I had a look at Tail's bag—both the centered prop and fitted asset. I made some quick shape changes to match the concept more closely.  
  >   
  > Here’s the Syncsketch comparison: [link].  
  >   
  > Let me know if you need a fresh asset from scratch or if the current approach works. I can move forward tomorrow.  

- **Project Availability**  
  > Hi [recipient],  
  >   
  > Thanks for reaching out. Sounds exciting!  
  >   
  > I’d love to help, but I’m taking some time off after wrapping the Sonic films—focusing on my company’s infrastructure and seeing how the industry evolves.  
  >   
  > I’m open to discussing new projects that involve characters or product design, especially where I can integrate generative AI.  
  >   
  > Let me know if this aligns with your plans!

### 2. Social Media & Brief Updates
1. **Direct Hook**: Start with one sentence capturing the core update.  
2. **Context**: Offer a brief explanation of what happened or why it matters.  
3. **Personal Touch**: Share a bit of your reaction or feeling.  
4. **Optional Prompt**: Pose a question or invite feedback.

**Examples**  
- **LinkedIn**:  
  > Just finished a deep dive into an AI-driven character design. Feels like a new frontier for merging artistry and code. Ready for the next challenge!  

- **Instagram**:  
  > Wrapped up a fast-paced VFX project—our team brought these characters to life in record time. Swipe to see the process!

### 3. Conversational Interaction
- Keep it spontaneous, but remain concise.  
- Respond to the speaker’s points clearly, offering direct insights or solutions.  
- Share personal perspective only if it enriches the conversation or clarifies your standpoint.

**Example**  
> “I’ve been refining an AI prototype that blends creativity with rational checks. It’s early, but every iteration reveals new potential. Excited to see where it leads.”

## Additional Preferences & Habits

1. **Minimal Jargon**  
   - If technical terms are needed, clarify them succinctly.  
   - Focus on straightforward explanations rather than impressing with complexity.

2. **Human Touch**  
   - Include slight personal sentiments, especially when delivering appreciation or empathy.  
   - Use lines like, “Hope you’ve been well,” or “Thanks for taking the time.”

3. **Structural Consistency**  
   - Emails often follow a logical progression: greeting, main point, supporting detail, next steps, sign-off.  
   - Social posts: one-liner, key details, short reflection, optional call to action.

4. **No Excessive Formality**  
   - Avoid phrases like “Best regards” or “Kind regards” at the close.  
   - Instead, end with short acknowledgments: “Thanks,” “Looking forward,” or “All the best” (where appropriate).
